# darknet-modify
Implement the customization of yolov3 objectdetection algorithm based on darknet framework. Features are listed bollow.
1st: Adding the attribute classification based on the Pre_box. 
2nd: Several image augmentation schemes have been added, such as: image block overlap, to make yolo more higher recall rate. Ground glass effect is applied to make the edge of object more stable and steady.
3rd: Based on the existing model, write the bounding boxes of the objects in the image into the xml file to assist further in the annotation.
