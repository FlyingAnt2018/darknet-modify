# darknet-modify
Implement the customization of yolov3 object detection algorithm based on darknet framework. Features are listed bollow.
1st: Adding the attribute classification based on the Pre_box. 
2nd: Several image augmentation schemes have been added, such as: image block overlap, to make yolo more higher recall rate. Ground glass effect is applied to make the edge of object more stable and steady.
3rd: Based on the existing model, write the bounding boxes of the objects in the image into the xml file to assist further in the annotation.
we provide all related source code, and corresponding executable file can be generated.
